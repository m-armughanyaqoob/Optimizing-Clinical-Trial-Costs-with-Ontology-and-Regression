# Optimizing-Clinical-Trial-Costs-with-Ontology-and-Regression

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing clinical trial costs using ontology-based categorization and regression models. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, we aim to identify key cost drivers and provide actionable insights for cost optimization in clinical trials.

### Objectives

- To analyze clinical trial cost data across multiple categories.
- To apply ontology-based categorization to better understand cost distributions.
- To use regression models to predict and optimize future clinical trial costs.
- To identify opportunities for cost reduction and efficiency improvements.

### Project Structure

This repository contains the following files:

- **`Analysis and Regression .ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook includes the initial data analysis and preprocessing steps. It explores the dataset, cleans the data, and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand cost patterns and distributions. Moreover, it focuses on applying regression models to predict clinical trial costs and includes advanced statistical techniques, such as ARIMA and Random Forest regression, to model cost behaviors and optimize budget allocations.

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project consists of clinical trial cost data, including various categories such as Imaging Fees, Pharmacy Fees, IRB/EC Fees, Setup and Start-Up Fees, Screening Fees, Periodic Visits Fees, Miscellaneous Fees, and Administrative Fees. The data covers multiple investigators and includes timestamps for cost events.


## Analysis and Methodology


1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: The notebook begins by loading the dataset and performing necessary data cleaning steps, such as converting data types and handling missing values.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Various EDA techniques are applied to understand the distribution of costs across different categories and investigators. Visualization techniques such as heatmaps and line plots are used to analyze trends and patterns.

3. **Ontology-Based Categorization**: The cost categories are analyzed using an ontology-based approach, grouping similar categories and understanding their interrelationships.

1. **Regression Analysis**: The notebook applies regression models to predict clinical trial costs based on historical data. Techniques such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, and Random Forest Regression are used to model cost behaviors.

2. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared to determine the most effective model for cost prediction.

3. **Cost Optimization**: The results from the regression models are used to provide recommendations for cost optimization, identifying key areas where cost savings can be achieved.

## Results and Findings

- **Cost Drivers**: The analysis identified key cost drivers across different categories, highlighting areas with the highest expenditure and variability.
  
- **Predictive Accuracy**: The regression models achieved high predictive accuracy, with the Random Forest model providing the best performance with an R-squared of 0.9969.

- **Optimization Opportunities**: By applying the models, potential cost-saving opportunities were identified, particularly in categories like Imaging Fees and Pharmacy Fees, where cost variations were significant.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using ontology-based analysis and regression models to optimize clinical trial costs. The insights gained from this analysis can help stakeholders make informed decisions, reduce unnecessary expenses, and improve overall trial efficiency.
